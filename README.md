This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to accessing elements before the Document Object Model (DOM) is fully loaded.  The script attempts to manipulate the "myDiv" element before the browser has completely parsed it, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates proper handling by adding an event listener to the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
